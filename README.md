  # Prework Study Guide Webpage

## In making this project, I set out with the intention to learn by doing and was constantly motivated by each enlightening step taken toward finishing the study guide webpage. Not only was the assigned project a seemingly acheivable one, but a useful one! The study guide is a reference tool for those in bootcamp to use as needed.
